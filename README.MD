Arduino-powered Alarm System With Keypad
==================================================


This is the source code to a ver simple alarm system. Basically an independantly powered laser pointer acts a s a light source. 
A heavily sheilded from light 5k photo-resistor is the sensor. You might have to tweak the values based on your light 
condidions. The speaker is a super cheapie from a toy. There is a picture here to help you visualize!
